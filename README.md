birthed out of necessity after a kickboxing injury, i was sent to rehab and came home with a laundry list of stretches and exercises i needed to perform daily in order to heal. it was overwhelming! how would i ever remember to do them all, let alone do them every day?

utilizing React and their recently added Hooks technology, i developed a responsive, dynamic and easy-to-use web application that allows users to upload custom rehabilitation routines, add notes about specific exercises and gives the option to link a url image for easy visual recognition.

a checkbox input allows users to indicate what they have completed each day and a single click removes each exercise from the routine.

the original code was developed in tandem with London App Brewery's Web Development Course and expanded to develop this idea.
